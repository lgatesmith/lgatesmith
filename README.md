# Hi, I'm Lily 👋

**Front-end developer with a designer's sensibility. Available for work.**

With a rich background in the arts, fashion, design, and programming, I bring a unique perspective to front-end development. I appreciate web projects for all of their complexities: as interactive works of digital art, technical challenges to solve elegantly, and systems to be easily maintained by clients after handoff. 

### What I do
- 🤝 **Partner with agencies** as a front-end developer, building pixel-perfect websites and consulting on interactive functionality and web best practices
- 🎨 **WordPress specialist:** Custom themes, reusable React-based Gutenberg modules, ACF Pro, CMS architecture with custom post types, AJAX filtering
- ⚛️ **JavaScript ecosystem:** Mastering React, learning TypeScript
- ✨ **Learning 3D for the web:** WebGL and Three.js for interactive experiences and creative coding projects (games are the dream!)

**💼 Available for full-time and contract opportunities**

### What I bring
A designer's eye for aesthetics. A developer's commitment to clean, scalable code. Over ten years of  creative experience.

### Ask me about
WordPress workflows, Columbo, design systems, or my favorite fashion designers.
