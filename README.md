# Hi, I’m Lily 👋

Front-end–focused engineer with nearly a decade of experience building, shipping, and maintaining real-world web projects.

I work at the intersection of design and engineering, translating visual intent into clean, production-ready interfaces and scalable front-end systems.

## What I do
- Partner with agencies as a senior individual contributor on client-facing web projects
- Implement pixel-perfect UI and collaborate closely with designers on interaction and behavior
- Architect and build CMS-driven platforms (custom themes, custom post types, reusable blocks, ACF Pro, AJAX filtering, API integrations)
- Build modern front-end applications using **React, TypeScript/JavaScript, and Next.js**
- Explore creative coding through WebGL / three.js, web animation, and experimental UI work

## What I bring
A designer’s eye for aesthetics and detail, paired with a developer’s focus on clarity, maintainability, and long-term ownership.
