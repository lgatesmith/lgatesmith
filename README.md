## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸŽ¨ Creative Technologist & Frontend Developer

I'm a multidisciplinary creator with backgrounds in fine art, fashion design, and graphic design who brings a unique perspective to web development. I approach projects through three complementary lenses: design thinking, user experience, and technical implementation.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working as Head of Development at a creative agency in St. Paul
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning React and WebGL to create more expressive digital experiences
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the intersection of art and technology
- ðŸš€ My passion: Crafting fun, beautiful, interactive web experiences
- ðŸ§  My approach: Harmonizing artistic sensibility with technical precision
- ðŸ“« Available for select collaborations, particularly at the art-tech intersection

When I'm not coding, you might find me sketching, experimenting with new design tools, or exploring interactive art installations for inspiration!
