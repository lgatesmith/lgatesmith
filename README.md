## Hi there 👋

### 🎨 Front End Engineer & Creative Technologist

I'm a multidisciplinary developer with a diverse background in fine art, fashion, and graphic design, bringing my unique perspective to web development. I specialize in crafting pixel-perfect CMS sites, with a focus on WordPress.

- 👩‍💻 I'm currently working as a full-time contractor serving private clients and collaborating with agencies in a development role
- 🌀 I'm expanding my skills in 3D technologies like WebGL to create more expressive digital experiences
- 💗 My passion: Writing clean, maintainable code that functions seamlessly
- 📫 Available for select collaborations, particularly at the art-tech intersection

When I'm not coding, you might find me watching old movies, playing Sudoku, or exploring interactive art installations for inspiration!
