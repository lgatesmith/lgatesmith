## Hi there 👋

### 🎨 Frontend Developer & Creative Technologist

I'm a multidisciplinary creator with a diverse background in fine art, fashion design, and graphic design, bringing my unique perspective to frontend development. I approach projects through three complementary lenses: design thinking, user experience, and technical implementation.

- 👩‍💻 I'm currently working as a full-time contractor building websites and web apps
- 🌀 I'm expanding my skills in React and WebGL to create more expressive digital experiences
- 💗 My passion: Crafting fun, beautiful, interactive web experiences
- 🎯 My approach: Harmonizing artistic sensibility with technical precision
- 📫 Available for select collaborations, particularly at the art-tech intersection

When I'm not coding, you might find me watching old movies, playing Sudoku, or exploring interactive art installations for inspiration!
